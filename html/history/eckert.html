    <h3>Who was J. Presper Eckert?</h3>
    <h4>J. Presper Eckert, or in full "John Presper Eckert Jr.", was an American engineer born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 9th 1919. Though originally enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School to study business, he transferred to the Moore School of Electrical Enigeering in 1937, where he made several improvements in computing equipment at the time. The first patent he applied for, at age 21 in the year 1940, was for the "Light Modulating Method and Apparatus". The basic purpose of the apparatus was, in simple terms, to modulate a light beam in an optical processing system. </h4>
