    <h2>Welcome to the page on J. Presper Eckert!</h2>

    <h3>Who was J. Presper Eckert?</h3>
    <h4>J. Presper Eckert, or in full "John Presper Eckert Jr.", was an American engineer born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 9th 1919. Though originally enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School to study business, he transferred to the Moore School of Electrical Enigeering in 1937, where he made several improvements in computing equipment at the time. The first patent he applied for, at age 21 in the year 1940, was for the <i>Light Modulating Method and Apparatus</i>. The basic purpose of the apparatus was, in simple terms, to modulate a light beam in an optical processing system. At the school, Eckert participated in research on radar timing, made improvements to the speed and overall precision of his school's differential analyzer (a type of analogue computer that solves differential equations using wheel and disc mechanisms), and even assisted in teaching a summer course in electronics under the <i>Engineering, Science, and Management War Training<i> offered through the school by the United States Department of War.</h4>

    <h4>Eckert and Mauchly both left the Moore School in March of 1946 because of a disagreement about the assignment of claims on intellectual property that was developed at the University. That year, the University had changed their patent policy, which would have made Eckert and Mauchly assign all of their patents to the University had they stayed after March. The agreement they reached with the University was that Eckert and Mauchly would both keep the patent rights to ENIAC, but the University had the right to license it to the government and to non-profit organizations. In the following months, the two started up the Electronic Control Company, which soon became the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. They ran into financial troubles in 1950, and the corporation was aquired by Remington Rand Corporation. Eckert remained with Remington Rand and became an executive, and even remained a consultant to the now-merged company Unisys after his retirement in 1989./h4>
