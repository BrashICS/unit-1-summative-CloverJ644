    <h3>Who was John Mauchly?</h3>
    <h4></h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Eckert and Mauchly both left the Moore School in March of 1946 because of a disagreement about the assignment of claims on intellectual property that was developed at the University. That year, the University had changed their patent policy, which would have made Eckert and Mauchly assign all of their patents to the University had they stayed after March. The agreement they reached with the University was that Eckert and Mauchly would both keep the patent rights to ENIAC, but the University had the right to license it to the government and to non-profit organizations. In the following months, the two started up the Electronic Control Company, which soon became the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. They ran into financial troubles in 1950, and the corporation was aquired by Remington Rand Corporation. </h4>
