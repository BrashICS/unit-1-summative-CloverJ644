    <h2>Welcome to the page on John Mauchly!</h2>

    <h3>Who was John Mauchly?</h3>
    <h4>John Mauchly, or in full "John William Mauchly", was an American physicist and engineer born in Cincinnati, Ohio on August 30th 1907. Mauchly attended McKinley Technical High School in Washington, DC, where he was extremely active in the school's debate team. He was also a member of the national honor society, and became the editor-in-chief of the school's newspaper, <i>Tech Life</i>. After graduating in 1925, Mauchly earned a scholarship to study engineering at Johns Hopkins University. He then transferred to the physics department and, without completing his undergraduate degree, earned a Ph.D. in physics in 1932. For the next year, Mauchly worked as a research assistant at the University, where he was particularly interested in calculating energy levels of the formaldehyde spectrum. His teaching career properly began when he was appointed the head of the physics department at Ursinus College in 1933. It's worth noting that he was, in fact, the only staff member. In 1941, Mauchly ended up meeting Eckert through taking a course in wartime electronics that he took at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, a part of the University of Pennsylvania which Eckert had just recently graduated from.</h4>

    <h4>Eckert and Mauchly both left the Moore School in March of 1946 because of a disagreement about the assignment of claims on intellectual property that was developed at the University. That year, the University had changed their patent policy, which would have made Eckert and Mauchly assign all of their patents to the University had they stayed after March. The agreement they reached with the University was that Eckert and Mauchly would both keep the patent rights to ENIAC, but the University had the right to license it to the government and to non-profit organizations. In the following months, the two started up the Electronic Control Company, which soon became the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation. They ran into financial troubles in 1950, and the corporation was aquired by Remington Rand Corporation. In 1959, Mauchly left Remington Rand and started Mauchly Associates, Inc. One of the company's most notable achievements was the development of the Critical Path Method, which proved useful for automated construction scheduling.</h4>
